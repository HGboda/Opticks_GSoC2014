LiDAR segmentation Plug-In based on RANSAC and PCA algorithms for Opticks

This is the reporsitory for Opticks GSoC 2014: LiDAR segmentation Plug-In based on RANSAC and PCA algorithms.

For more information about this project: http://opticks.org/confluence/display/~roberta.ravanelli/GSoC+2014:+LiDAR+segmentation+Plug-In+based+on+RANSAC+and+PCA+algorithms+for+Opticks

Now the program writes some results on 3 different file:
Points.txt: the  ORIGINAL coordinates of all the points in the point cloud
DEM.txt: the DEM generated by the original point cloud
Ransac_results.txt: the results of the RANSAC algorithm applied to the original point cloud
In order to produce this file, you need to create a Results directory on your Desktop and to change the username in the path string:
Ransac.cpp line 8: path = "C:/Users/Roberta/Desktop/Results/"; --> path = "C:/Users/your_username/Desktop/Results/";

================ OpenCV ================
To add the openCV highgui methods I changed the openCV property sheets (SDK_HOME\application\CompileSettings), adding the opencv_highgui220.lib to the line 11 (<AdditionalDependencies>).
Then, to run the Plug-In I copied the open_cv_highgui220.dll from the sdk dependencies (SDK_HOME\Dependencies\64\bin) to the Opticks installation bin folder (C:\Program Files\Opticks\4.12Nightly20140410.18697\Bin)

I also copied the cxcore.h header file (needed for the conversion from/to OpenCV- eigen matrices) in the SDK_HOME\Dependencies\64\include\opencv2\core directory

=============== Test point cloud ========
You can find a test point cloud at the link below:
